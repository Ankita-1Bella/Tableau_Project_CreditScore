# This dashboard provides information based on the data taken as to which factors play important role while determining the credit score of an individual
The dashboard provides a wealth of information about how various factors such as education, gender, previous loan defaults, home ownership status, and loan intent influence credit scores and loan amounts. 

Here's a detailed explanation of each section of the dashboard along with inferences and how it is linked to finance:

1. Qualification vs Credit Score (Person Education):
   - This bar chart shows the average credit score for individuals with different educational qualifications: Associate, Bachelor, Doctorate, High School, and Master.
   - Inference: Higher educational qualifications generally correlate with higher average credit scores. This suggests that individuals with higher education levels may be more financially responsible or have better access to financial resources.
   - Financial Link: Lenders can use this information to assess the risk associated with lending to individuals based on their education levels. Higher credit scores can result in better loan terms and lower interest rates.

2. Gender vs Loan Amount (Person Gender):
   - This bar chart compares the average loan amount between females and males.
   - Inference: The average loan amount is similar for both genders, indicating that gender does not significantly influence the loan amount granted.
   - Financial Link: This insight can help ensure that lending practices are fair and unbiased with respect to gender, promoting equality in financial opportunities.

3. Loan Default vs Loan Interest Rate (Previous Loan Defaults On File):
   - This bar chart shows the average loan interest rate for individuals with and without previous loan defaults.
   - Inference: Individuals with previous loan defaults tend to have higher average loan interest rates, reflecting the increased risk perceived by lenders.
   - Financial Link: Lenders can adjust interest rates based on an individual's credit history, helping to mitigate the risk of loan defaults and ensuring that interest rates are aligned with the borrower's risk profile.

4. Home Ownership Status vs Credit Score (Person Home Ownership):
   - This bar chart compares the credit scores of individuals based on their home ownership status: Mortgage, Other, Own, and Rent.
   - Inference: Individuals who own their homes or have a mortgage generally have higher credit scores compared to those who rent or fall under the "Other" category. Home ownership status can be an indicator of financial stability.
   - Financial Link: Lenders can use home ownership status as a factor in determining creditworthiness and loan terms, with homeownership indicating lower risk.

5. Loan Amount vs Loan Intent (Loan Intent):
   - This bar chart shows the average loan amount for different loan intents: Debt Consolidation, Education, Home Improvement, Medical, Personal, and Venture.
   - Inference: The average loan amount varies depending on the purpose of the loan. For example, loans for education and home improvement tend to have higher average amounts compared to personal or medical loans.
   - Financial Link: Understanding the purpose of loans helps lenders tailor their loan products and services to meet the specific needs of borrowers, ensuring that loan amounts are appropriate for the intended use.

6. Ownership vs Loan Amount (Person Home Ownership):
   - This bar chart compares the total loan amount based on home ownership status: Mortgage, Other, Own, and Rent.
   - Inference: Individuals with a mortgage or who rent tend to have higher total loan amounts compared to those who own their homes outright or fall under the "Other" category. This could be due to the need for larger loans to finance home purchases or rental expenses.
   - Financial Link: Lenders can use this information to assess the financial needs of borrowers based on their home ownership status, ensuring that loan products are aligned with their financial situation.
